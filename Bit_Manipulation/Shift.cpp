/**
 * @brief 
 * It is a binary operator that takes two numbers, 
 * left shifts the bits of the first operand, and the 
 * second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
 * In other words, left-shifting an integer “a” with an integer “b” 
 * denoted as ‘(a<<b)’ is equivalent to multiplying a with 2^b (2 raised to power b).
