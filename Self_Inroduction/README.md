# Introduce Yourself

Good morning/afternoon/evening,

My name is Abhishek Zade, and I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Trinity College. I completed my Bachelor’s in Information Technology with Honors in Data Science from AISSMS Institutes of Information Technology, Pune University, where I graduated with an 8.77 GPA.

During my undergraduate studies, I interned as a Frontend Developer at Zenture IT Solutions, a Pune-based startup, and participated in the Google Summer of Code 2021. In that program, I contributed to a project called TouchCompatibility to Simulator, which enabled mobile-based access to software. My final year project also focused on cutting-edge techniques, as I developed a machine learning and natural language processing solution for subjective answer evaluation.

I am proficient in C++ and JavaScript and have experience working with Python, Django, and React.js. In addition to my technical skills, I served as the Media Head for my college, managing a team of 40 students from various departments, and I have also worked as a freelance video editor for a prominent Delhi-based YouTube channel with over 700K subscribers.

More recently, I gained valuable industry experience at Jio Platforms Limited, where I spent a year working on backend systems using Next.js and Node.js. I believe my technical expertise, practical project experience, and leadership background position me well to contribute to the innovative environment at Amazon.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Abhishek Zade



# Extra
Despite being a 2022 graduate and a fresher, I have an impressive track record as a Google Summer of Code 2021 participant, where I was mentored by experienced developers from both Google and Adobe. This year, I've taken on the role of mentoring students in Google Summer of Code, demonstrating my commitment to giving back to the community.

Unlike current students, I have the advantage of being a graduate, which allows me to dedicate more time and effort to projects. In fact, I am ready to commit to a full-time internship position, harnessing my skills and expertise to contribute effectively.

My proficiency in ReactJS is unquestionable, as I have successfully built complex projects, including those involving WebRTC technology. I'm not just a learner; I'm a capable and resourceful developer ready to take on challenging tasks and deliver exceptional results.

So, if you're looking for someone who can hit the ground running, make a significant impact, and provide mentorship with a proven track record, look no further. I'm your candidate of choice.
