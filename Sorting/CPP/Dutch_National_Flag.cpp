The Dutch National Flag algorithm is a sorting algorithm that partitions 
an array containing elements of three distinct values 
(for example, 0s, 1s, and 2s) into three parts, in a single traversal of the array. 
The algorithm is named after the Dutch national flag, 
which has three horizontal stripes of red, white, and blue.
